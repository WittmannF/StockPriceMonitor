# StockPriceMonitor
This Python code will acquire the prices of stocks of Petrobras (PBR) every 60
seconds and save to a database (update path to save). It is useful when
you would like to monitor the price of a stock in order to take action 
in case it go up or down. If you would like to monitor a different stock
than PBR, just update the link (it has to be from the stockstwits' website)

Goals for the next versions:
- Create alarms to send to the email address of the user
